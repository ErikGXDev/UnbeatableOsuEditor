# Unbeatable Osu Editor

A custom osu!(lazer) ruleset that makes creating UNBEATABLE beatmaps easier.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
> You can download the latest version of the ruleset from the [releases page](https://github.com/ErikGXDev/UnbeatableOsuEditor/releases).

The ruleset consists of a zip file containing 3 files that you need to extract into the `rulesets` folder of your osu!lazer installation.

### Installation instructions

1. Navigate to the osu!lazer data directory. You can do so by opening the settings panel in osu!lazer and clicking on the "open osu! folder" button. Alternatively you can directly navigate to the `rulesets` directory via your OS directory explorer at the following locations:

   - `%AppData%/osu/rulesets` on Windows
   - `~/.local/share/osu/rulesets` on Linux / macOS

   **NOTE**: If you have relocated your osu! data directory to another directory, the `rulesets` directory will be there instead.

2. Extract the ruleset's zip file contents into the `rulesets` directory.

3. Start osu!lazer and begin creating by selecting the ruleset in the top left and entering the editor.
   If osu!lazer was running while installing the ruleset, you may need to restart the game in order for the ruleset to appear.

## Features
